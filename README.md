### About
GW2 Organizer v2.0 allows you to view which of your characters could benefit from more bag space! It's based on the awesome tool over at gw2organizer.com.

---

### Notes:
In order to modernize the tool, I've made a few changes:
 - I've removed jQuery, since it's really no longer needed for what we're doing.
 - I've added VueJS to make the view more dynamic
 - I've converted the file to ES6 (`let`, `const`, etc.).
 - I've included a gulp process to minify the resultant front-end code.

Got a suggestion/improvement? Feel free to submit a pull request!
